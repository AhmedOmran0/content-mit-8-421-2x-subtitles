Let's now make it more interesting.
Let's replace the proton by a positron, the anti-particle
of the electron.
So now we have the same, a similar situation.
But what happens now is, of course, the contribution
to the magnetic moment from the nucleus, which is now
the positron, is as important as a contribution of the electron.
So, you have two spin one-halfs coupled now.
One is positive.
One is negative.
And you should figure out again, what are the energies?
But before we talk about the energies,
let's first talk about how many hyperfine states do we
have in the ground state.
One, two, three, or four?

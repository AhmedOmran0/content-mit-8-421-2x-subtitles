Next question, from hydrogen to helium.
In helium, for the same electronic configuration,
singlet or triplet states more tightly bound?
So we talked about a shift or splitting between singlet
and triplets states.
Which way does it go?
For the same electronic configuration. I'm not asking about
the ground state which has only one state.
There's only one state in the ground state,
but now we go to the excited state, to the excited states.
And there are a number of excited states, because they
have the same configuration, but they can be classified as singlet and triplet states.

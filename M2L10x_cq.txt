Now, we go to the more complicated case,
to low magnetic fields.
And again, same question, what are the magnetic moments
of those hyperfined states?
So your four states, the number of states, of course,
doesn't change.
That's the dimension of our Hilbert space.
But now, we had low magnetic field,
and what is the magnetic moment, which is nothing
else than, the derivative of the energy, with respect
to the magnetic field?

Step forward to the optical spectroscopy.
You'll remember originally-- and this is why the Lamb Shift
wasn't jumping into people's eye when they did spectroscopy
of the Balmer Spectrum of hydrogen--
you cannot resolve the structure,
the Lamb Shift is there, but it's hidden in the envelope
of the unresolved lines.
And now the advent of lasers.
And people immediately developed saturation spectroscopy.
That's how most of our laboratories
stabilized their lasers, using Doppler-free saturation
spectroscopy.
And when saturation spectroscopy was
invented by Hansch and Shawlow, for the first time
you can break through the Doppler [INAUDIBLE].
And now you see the lines resolved.
And here, I think for the first time,
you see two peaks separated, and the splitting
is the Lamb Shift, which until then, was only accessible
for radio frequency methods.
Of course, these were the first lasers, just pulse lasers.
And you couldn't even think about precision.
But then of course, using metrology,
using frequency chains, people do precision measurements
in the optical domain.
And these are now papers in the '90s.
Optical measurement on the Lamb Shift
in the ground state, not only the excited state.
Talking about the comparison with experiment and theory.
So experimental is pushed to higher and higher precision,
and suddenly there was a discrepancy.
And it was a discrepancy in the 1 S Lamb Shift.
In the 1 S state, the Lamb Shift is much bigger
than in 2S state, because the electron interacts much more
intimately with the origin where the Coulomb potential is
strongest.
And people found that the experiment didn't any longer
agree with theory.
But then the theorists had to check all their assumptions,
and it was found that there's some two
new binding corrections which were surprisingly large.
Often, you make an estimate that those terms are small.
But you say it's higher order, but you may not
know the pre-factor.
And here, something was surprisingly large,
and by now you've proven the theory
there was again, agreement between experiment and theory.
It's getting now down to the kilohertz level.
At least as a few years ago, this
was sort of state of the art.
Remember, the Lamb Shift is about 1,000 megacycles,
1 gigahertz.
And now the precision is in the single kilohertz.

And as I pointed out, precision was
reached by directing, measuring the frequency of lasers,
frequency metrology.
This was actually-- for historic interest,
frequency metrology they use peak nodes
between the laser used to measure the hydrogen
line and some other lasers.
So this is just a few years before comb generators,
frequency combs completely changed things again.
But they had already the precision of a direct frequency
measurement.
You can read about it when I paused it.
It shows you what the error budget
is in those measurements.
This is the slide I borrowed from Ted Hansch.
Optical Spectroscopy of Hydrogen.
It just shows the advances in frequency metrology.
It shows that how caesium clocks and optical spectroscopy-- how
they have changed in precision.
And eventually we are now past the time
where optical spectroscopy is more
accurate than microwave and radio frequency spectroscopy.
Optical clocks are more accurate than the caesium frequency
standards.
And I'm sure in your lifetime you will experience
a redefinition of the second, because the caesium clock is
no longer accurate enough to compare with the most
precise optical measurements.
And I think there was a peak gap-- a change in slope here.
In the old days, you measured the wavelengths of light
by making a measurement of the wavelengths
using maybe a grading, or interferometry.
But when you now started to measure frequencies directly,
then there was a change in slope,
and major improvements in precision.
And today, of course, the most precise measurements
of laser frequencies is not through the wavelengths,
directly count the number of cycles in a peak node,
with an optical comb generator.
So what can you do with ever-increasing precision?
If you measure very, very accurately,
an atomic line-- let's say the 1S 2S
transition in hydrogen using 2 photon spectroscopy-- what you
can do is you can measure it, and a few years later, you
can measure it again.
And now it becomes an interesting question
if you have this precision.
Will the result be the same as a function of time?
If there were a small change, which there wasn't, you
could only come to one conclusion,
and this is fundamental constants in nature,
change as a function of time.
So at least precision of the metrology
is now being used to test with a fundamental constants,
or nearly constant as a function of time.
Precision is even more improving.
The latest in the development of the spectroscopy of hydrogen
is what is called the size of the proton puzzle.
In your homework assignment, you are actually
calculating what is the correction due to transition
frequencies in hydrogen?
Because you don't have a proton field of a point particle,
the proton has a finite size.
Or vice versa.
If you have sufficient prediction,
if you have sufficient accuracy of the measurement,
you can determine the size of the proton
from the measured transition frequencies.
And this was done.
And in 2010 there was the big surprise
that the size of the proton determined
form hydrogen spectroscopy did not
agree with scattering measurements
where you scatter I think, electrons and protons
to measure the proton size.
So this is still a puzzle.
It's called the proton radius puzzle,
and it's not clear what is causing it.
What happened is in 2010, that there
was a big improvement in measuring
the size of the proton, and this was
done by replacing the electron with a muon, which
is a heavy electron.
But since the muon is so much heavier,
the bore orbit of the muon, the negative particle
going around the proton is much smaller.

So therefore the-- Lamb Shift also--
but also the correction due to the finite size of the proton
is much, much larger, because there
is much more overlay of the muonic wave
function with the proton than from electron.
So there was a huge improvement in the precision
of the measurement of the proton size.
And this has really lead to what is called the proton radius
puzzle.
And it's not sure if that is at the same level of the Lamb
Shift, which gave rise just fundamental new physics.
Maybe this is the discovery of a new Lamb Shift in 2010,
and it changes our understanding of fundamental physics.
But maybe it's something else.
The answer is not there.
At least this is 2010.
A few years of checking the theory
and checking the experiment has not removed the discrepancy.
Rather to the contrary, it has hardened
that there is some discrepancy which needs to be resolved.
So this was just sort of a little shot of excursion,
or a little bit of summary of spectroscopy of hydrogen
over 80 years from precursors to the Lamb Shift,

Let me now quickly discuss with you isotope effects.

And I know that many people here know about isotope effects
because, if you lock your laser to a lithium cell
or to a rubidium cell, you find lithium-6 and lithium-7 peaks,
and in rubidium, rubidium-85 and rubidium-87.
So there are two peaks, which are spectrally very, very
well resolved.
And now I tell you what causes the splitting between the lines
of rubidium-85 and rubidium-87.
Well the first effect is really trivial.
It's the mass effect.
And I have to remind you that the Rydberg
formula for a single electron energy level
contains the reduced mass.
In other words, the energy levels
are the energy levels if you assume
that the mass of the nucleus is infinite.
That means you just take, for the electron mass
in the Rydberg constant, the electron mass.
But in general, you have to take the reduced mass.

The big M is the nucleus, and small m is the electron.
The simplest case, is if you set the nuclear mass to infinity,
then you simply have the Rydberg constant with the electron
mass.
So in the limit that the nuclear mass is
much larger than the electron mass,
this correction factor is 1 minus little m over big M.
So therefore, the correction factor is on the order of 10
to the 4 or 10 to the 5.
Visible frequencies are on the order of 10 to the 14.
So 10 to the minus 4 or 10 to the minus 5 of it
is between 1 and 10 gigahertz.
So this is the scale for mass corrections
due to the isotope effect.
What is the sign of the isotope effect?
Does the fact that the nucleus has a finite mass,
does that mean that the binding energy of the electron
is smaller or larger?
[INAUDIBLE]

The absolute value of the binding ener--
[INAUDIBLE]
Look at your signs.
I would say it in the following Let's start
out with an infinite nucleus, and only the electron
is moving.
But now we make the nucleus lighter.
And that means the nucleus also has
to move because it's a two-body problem.
And there is additional kinetic energy,
additional kinetic energy of the nucleus.
And kinetic energy is positive and weakens the binding energy
of the total system.
So therefore, the fact that-- and
the effective mass correction means,
the lighter the nucleus is, the more kinetic energy
has to be added to the system for the nuclear motion.
And the more the binding energy is weakened.
The most dramatic example is not the hydrogen atom.
It is positronium.
Where your nucleus is not a nucleus,
it's a positively charged electron.
It's a positronium.
And in this situation, you have an effective mass,
which is only one half of the electron mass.
And the 1S-2S transition, which is Lyman-alpha for hydrogen,
is now not even in the vacuum UV.
It just happens at ordinary UV transitions.
And that means now, you know, the 1S-2S energy
is smaller by a factor of two.
That really means the binding energy between an electron
and a positron is only 50% of the binding
energy of an electron in the hydrogen atom.

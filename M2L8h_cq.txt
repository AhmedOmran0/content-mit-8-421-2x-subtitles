OK.
So we have discussed those fundamental symmetries,
but now I want to discuss something else related to it.
Let's assume you have a nucleus.
Is there a minimum requirement for the nucleus,
for the angular momentum of the nucleus,
in order to have a magnetic dipole,
or to have an electric quadrupole.
So let's formulate it as a clicker question.
So here let's assume A is possible for any nucleus,
no matter what the angular momentum is.
Here we put in one half, or larger than one.
And for the electric quadrupole we have the same choices.
So you should decide, if I tell you
a nucleus has a magnetic dipole, does
that imply that there is a minimum amount of angular
momentum of the nucleus there.
And then we repeat the same question
for the electric quadrupole.

Which interaction reflects that the potential between nucleus
and electron is not exactly a Coulomb potential, 1/r?
We've usually discussed Schrodinger equation, hydrogen,
Bohr model, for an exact 1/r potential.
But then we discussed a lot of phenomena,
and I want you to figure out now which of those choices
mean in essence that you do not have a 1/r potential.

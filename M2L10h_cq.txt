The next question.
So we understand now, there's a difference between triplet
and singlet state in excited states
for the same electronic configuration.
And the question is, what is the origin
of the energy which is splitting the singlet
from the triplet state?
Magnetic energy, spin-spin interactions,
or electrostatic interactions?

I mentioned that the oscillator strength is actually
one way to parametrize a matrix element.
We'll actually talk most of the lecture
today about matrix elements, but I
come to that in a few minutes.
For me, the matrix element itself is not a quantity you 
want to think about.
Sure, it has the dimension of the Bohr radius,
but you don't even think in terms of length scale.
There are two ways how you're going to use a matrix element.
One is the matrix element squared times
some other factor gives you the spontaneous line
widths, and actual line widths, and that's
a number you should know about your favorite atoms.
Or another way to parametrize matrix element
is by this dimensionless number, which is called the oscillator
strength.
And that's, of course, also related
to semi-classical physics, and I mentioned
that in the last class-- that the oscillator strength allows
us to connect the quantum mechanical treatment of an atom
to the response of a classical harmonic oscillator
with a charge to an external electric field.
So I use this expression that was the end of last class.
I used this expression for the matrix element
in terms of the oscillator strengths
to give you a nice relationship for strong transition,
as in the alkali d-lines where the oscillator
strength is close to 1.
You see that the matrix element is 1 over square root 2 times
the geometric mean of the Compton
wavelengths of the electron and the wavelength
of the transition.
So that's actually important for the dipole approximation,
because the Compton wavelength of the electron
is very, very small, so therefore if the matrix element
is the geometric mean of the two,
that means that the matrix element is smaller
than the optical wavelengths, and therefore the matrix
element is the length scale-- the relevant length scale--
of the atom for transition.
It is smaller than the optical wavelengths.
And that means-- and we'll talk about it today--
that in the expression e to the ikr, kr is really small.
So we can do that dipole approximation.

Now, I have a question for you.
I didn't bring clickers, because I don't have many questions
to discuss today, but this almost--
I mentioned that there is a sum rule for the oscillator
strengths, and the sum rule limits it to 1,
and if there's a really strong transition,
it kind of exhausts the sum rule--
and this is what I was talking about--
but because the thought crossed my mind after last lecture,
if I don't add something to it, you may actually use it
as a proof, which would be wrong,
that the matrix element cannot be larger than what is written
on the right-hand side.
On the other hand, we discussed in the context
of Rydberg atoms, that Rydberg atoms
can have huge matrix elements, matrix elements which
they can really become huge.
So how do you reconcile the fact that Rydberg atoms in large end
states-- in states with large principle quantum numbers--
can have huge matrix elements?
How do you reconcile it with our discussion of oscillator
strengths and sum rules?

The answer is simple but subtle.

So, is there the proof that peak matrix elements are not
possible?
Or if peak matrix elements-- huge matrix elements--
are possible, what property of the oscillator strength
did I not emphasize?
Use logic.
So first, are there atoms which have huge matrix elements?
Yes.
Rydberg atoms.
So the left-hand side can be really huge.
On the right-hand side, we have the wavelengths
of the transition, which can be-- depends-- can get large.
We have the Compton wavelengths, but then we
have the oscillator strengths.
And the oscillator strengths, the sum of all oscillator
strengths is 1, but you have to be careful
that not all oscillator strengths have to be positive.
The definition of the oscillator strengths
involves frequency from one state to the next,
and depending whether you go up or down,
the frequency has positive or negative sign.
So therefore we have a sum rule for the ground state.
All frequencies are positive, because you can only go up.
So therefore the sum rule is only
very useful for the ground state,
because all oscillator strengths are positive,
and if one oscillator strength is 1,
you know no other transition has any strength at all.
However, when you have an excited state that you
find in oscillator strength which is 1,
you could still have a lot of other strong transitions,
but the oscillator strengths are positive and negative,
and they compensate for each other in the sum rule.
So just be careful about that.
For the ground state, and this is what I've proven to you
here, I think fairly rigorously, if you are in the ground state,
the transition matrix element cannot be larger than
the geometric mean of the reduced wavelengths
and the Compton wavelengths, but for excited states you have
to be careful, because the oscillator strength can
[INAUDIBLE].

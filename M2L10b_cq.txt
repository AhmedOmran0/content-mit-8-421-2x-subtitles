The first questions take us back to electronic structure.
It's a question about how do wave functions,
how does density and how does inverse size scale
with principle quantum number?
So the first question is, how does
1 over r, 1 over the size of the electronic wave function,
how does it scale with n? 1 over, 1 over n squared, 1 over n cubed?

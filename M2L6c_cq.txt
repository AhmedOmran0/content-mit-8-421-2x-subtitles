The question is, what is the leading correction
to this formula.
Does the fact that we have in ionic core,
does it make a constant offset to the binding energy?
Or does it make the correction, which goes as 1 over n squared.
This [INAUDIBLE] scale-- the overall spectrum--
it would actually lead to a modified rescaled root back
constant.
Or is the correction higher order in n?
Or finally, is it a correction which
changes the you effective principle [INAUDIBLE]
to number n?

Maybe you know the answer or maybe you
want to try to guess the answer.

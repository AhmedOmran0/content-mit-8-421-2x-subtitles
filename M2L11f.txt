Atoms in oscillating electric fields.

Of course, the next step is, and this
is where we are working towards, we will in the next lectures
develop a deeper understanding what happens
when atoms interact with light.
And oscillating electric fields is already
pretty close to light.
And I want to actually also show you
that we capture already a lot of the phenomenon which happened
with light except for a full understanding
of spontaneous emission.
So we pretty much, when we use an oscillating electric field,
we allow the atom to interact with just one
mode of the electromagnetic field, which is
filled with a coherent state.
And this is so classical that we don't even
need field quantization.
We just use a classical electric field.
And this already gives us the interaction of atoms with light
except for spontaneous emission, which
involves all the other modes.
So that's what we do later, but today we
just do the same classical description
of an atom in an oscillating electric field.
And this is the theory of the AC Stark Effect.
So all we do is application of Time Dependent Perturbation
Theory.

So our electric field is now time dependent,
because the value epsilon polarization E hat,
and it oscillates.
Our perturbation Hamiltonian is exactly
the same type of Hamiltonian that we
had before for the DC Stark Effect,
but now it's a time dependent one.
And it will be useful to break up the oscillating
term into E to the I omega T and E to the minus I omega T.
I don't want to bore you with perturbation theory in quantum
mechanics, because you've all seen it in 805 or 806.
I just want to jump to the result.
You find more details about it on the Wiki,
but all you do is you parametrize your E function,
you expand it into eigenstates with aptitude AN,
and then you put it into the Schrodinger equation
and assume that for short to times
the atom is in the ground state, the amplitude
of the crown state is one and the amplitude of the excited
state is infinitesimal that you can use the lowest auto
perturbation.
This immediately gives you the first order result
for the amplitude in excited state K.
It only comes about because your initial state, the ground
state, is coupled by the matrix element to the excited state.
It's linear in applied electric field.
So what you do is you have to Schrodinger equation
and you indicated from time 0 to time one.
And since you have into E to the I omega T and E
to the minus I omega T, you get two time dependent terms.
So what appears now is we have the frequencies omega
N of the excited state.
And now when the couple the excited state
K to the ground state, what appears
is the frequency difference between the two.
It's pretty much the excitation gap.
And we have a time dependent oscillation at omega.
And then we have, of course, the same term where
we flip the sign from omega.
Let me write that more clearly.
Where we flip the sign form omega to minus omega.
So that's the second term.
By integrating an exponential function with respect to time,
we get an energy and frequency denominator, which is this one.
So this is really just straight forward, most basic,
clean [INAUDIBLE] application of perturbation theory.
The only thing I want to discuss,
because it's sometimes confuses people
is that we integrate form times 0 to the finite time.
And when you integrate, you get contributions
from the upper indication limit and from the lower integration
limit.
And this contribution at the lower integration limit
is actually a transient.
It is at the frequency.

It doesn't depend on omega, so it's
a big node between the ground and excited state.
I could say it frequency omega key,
but then it, it's too bad that with the ground state
it's only called KG.
And this is 2.
If you switch on appropriation, it's
like you suddenly switch on the type of harmonic oscillator.
And do you have some leaning, you
have a transient at the natural frequency
of the harmonic oscillator.
It has nothing to do with the drive,
it's just a sudden onset.
So, like any transition, we haven't included damping here.
We don't have spontaneous admission.
Everything is undamped.
But eventually all of those transients
will damp out with time.
And, as we should have known also from the beginning,
when we drive a system, and we switch on a perturbation
to think about an harmonic oscillator,
you have a response at the harmonic oscillator frequency,
which is always transient in nature,
and then you have a response at the drive frequency.
And we are interested, of course,
only in the driven response.

The driven response is at frequency plus minus omega.
That's how we drive it.
But now I have to be careful since I'm looking at the end
amplitude and I factor out the time dependence of ray
function, the time dependence of the eigenstates,
I'm now looking for drive terms in this expression
for the amplitude, which drive at frequency omega,
but modified by the frequency of the count state.
But anyway, what I mean is the relevant term is the one which
depends on omega and in the following discussion,
I simply top the minus one, because it's a transient if you
would switch on your time dependent electric field
in a smoother way, this term would disappear.
